## Differentiation in Models

- domain-specific: biomedical ([bioBERT](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/4/1234/5566506)), finance, legal, scientific)
- task-specific (summarisation, question-answering, content creation)
- multimodal models (text and images - incl. video)
- multilingual

# LLMs as a DIRECT data cleaning tool

## TASK: what are some issues you've encountered with wild caught datasets???

## Wild Caught Dataset Issues

- factual look up (nationalities),
- missing data (volume) -- talk about prompts & context,
- inconsistencies (country codes, ST, st street),
- harmonisation/matching (occupation-- are these two the same?)),
- text summary/extraction (sentiment)

## Data 

Example 1:
Example 2:
Example 3:

## How would you verify that the LLM is returning valid output reliably?

## Reliable LLM Agents

- Agentic models are ...
- Tool calling and modularisation
- Structured output modes

# Tasks

## Evaluating prompts along with output

Haley has encountered some missing data in the age column of her wild caught census data, and she tries using ChatGPT to fix the issue:

- [Chat 1](https://chatgpt.com/share/6828c268-85e0-8000-91ef-ceb73ed32d6c)
- [Chat 2](https://chatgpt.com/share/6828c2ee-a3b0-8000-a956-692974053b43)

<!-- - [Chat 1](https://chatgpt.com/share/6828c13e-191c-8000-8b3f-0a422a2e1dd0) -->

::: callout-note
## Discuss in groups [10 mins]

Examine the two chats:

- do they return the same data?
- which answer seems more reliable?
- is any important information missing from the chat?
- would you recommend that Haley use the LLM generated data in an analysis of trends in the average age of different suburbs?
- does your recommendation depend on the type of analysis?

<!-- - What would you think about when writing prompts (i.e. chatting with an LLM) for these tasks?  -->

## Verifying task success

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Data preparation tasks:

- **looking up missing information**
- **suggesting values**
- **harmonise different abbreviations**
- **comparing and categorising**
- **summarising text**
- **extracting information**
:::
::: {.column}
::: {.callout-note}

## Discuss in groups [10 min]

- Which of these tasks would you feel most confident using an LLM to complete? Why?
- Which of these tasks would you prefer to have a human complete? Why?
- Which of these tasks would be most difficult to verify the correctness of?
- How would your answers change depending on the type of data?
